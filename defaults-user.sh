# To be used with aliBuild option `--defaults user`.
#
# This defaults set is meant to be used on user computers.
#
#   * Builds AliRoot and AliPhysics without GEANT3, 4 and DPMJET, which fits
#     most of the use cases and speeds up compilation time dramatically
#   * Pinpoints AliRoot and AliPhysics to their latest tags, but they will be
#     overridden by using packages in development mode
#
# This defaults set will become the default and will replace "release" at some
# point.
